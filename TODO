 * Adapt gets_to_speak based on how many active users there are in a channel
 * Match based on two keywords not just a single one
 * Semantic awareness
 * Negging/possing (+++ or 'wtf' winnie)
 * Convert to twisted IRC + NLTK
 * Keep a frequency/business rating for channels
 * Fix user trust to reload dynamically
 * Done - Respond to direct inquiries
 * Make winnie spend a certain amount of the time 'away'
 * Channel inactivity should trigger /away or a provoking statement
