    winnie doesn't really have much going for her. You'll have to be
    polite while she tries to figure out how to be alive again. I regret
    to inform you that throughout the course of her existence, her
    code-base has experience more than its share of neglect.

    winnie is an IRC bot. She sits and waits for people to make statements, "this car
    is fast," "you are a fatass," "I have a rash." Everything that gets said over the
    period in which she observes a channel is recorded. Meticulously. Using the
    natural language processing toolkit ^1, she can analyse english on a really, really
    mediocre level.
