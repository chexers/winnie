    winnie is an IRC bot. She sits and waits for people to make statements, "this car
    is fast," "you are a fat," "I have a rash." Everything that is said over the
    period in which she observes a channel is recorded. Meticulously. Using the
    natural language processing toolkit (NLTK)[nltk.org] ^1, she can analyse English on a really, really mediocre level. Does some fundamental markov-chain generation too, that
    code is in a branch here somewhere.

    winnie doesn't really have much going for her. You'll have to be
    polite while she tries to figure out how to be alive again. I regret
    to inform you that throughout the course of her existence, her
    code-base has experience more than its share of neglect. It has also
    undergone an unfair amount of scope creep. It's incredibly impolite
    to judge.

    Please ignore any profanities you see while we sort this ~~shit~~ mess out. Winnie really does not mean it.
