![winnie, she so kawai](https://raw.github.com/jmkogut/winnie/master/doc/mascotu.jpg?raw=true)

## Why?

winnie is an IRC bot. She sits and waits for people to make statements, "this car is fast," "you are a fatass," "I have a rash." Everything that gets said over the period in which she observes a channel is recorded. Meticulously. Using the natural language processing toolkit [^1], she can analyse english on a really, really mediocre level. 


## What value does she bring?

Humour, sometimes. I can't count the amount of *hilarious* and _zany_ situations I've found myself in with my IRC pals, all thanks to winnie. She really is a champ. (I love you girl!) However retarded abzde [^2] may think she is.

I never had the time to actually make her that intelligent, the extent of her speaking abilities involve precisely parrotting people or markov chain generation, neither of which are entirely perfect. Give it time.

## Technical shit?

I thought you'd never ask! Have a gander at me [INSTALLATION] document. :)


### Thank you

Get fucked.
